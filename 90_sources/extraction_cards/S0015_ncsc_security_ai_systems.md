# Why this matters
Moves the conversation from “prompting” to whole-system security: training data, tooling, software supply chain.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Prompt injection is widely reported; there is no failsafe mitigation.
- Data poisoning is a concern; design systems so ML vulnerabilities don’t cause catastrophic failure.
- Standard cyber hygiene still applies (access control, supply chain security, updates).

# How to incorporate
- Add “security fundamentals still apply” to onboarding: do not treat ML as special-case exempt.

# Suggested links
- S0011 (OWASP Top 10)
- S0013 (prompt injection deeper analysis)
