# Why this matters
Adds useful framing on “supporting content” and structuring prompts for reliability.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Include supporting content: goals, user preferences, and relevant background.
- Encourage structured outputs and iterative refinement.

# How to incorporate
- Use in `/01_methodology/context_engineering.md` to justify supporting-content sections.
