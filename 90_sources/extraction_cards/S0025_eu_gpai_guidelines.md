# Why this matters
If the onboarding guide is used in enterprise contexts, the EU AI Act era increases demand for traceability, documentation, and transparency.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Providers have obligations for documentation and information sharing (depending on role and model type).
- Timelines and obligations can affect how organizations evaluate and deploy genAI.

# How to incorporate
- Include as an optional appendix for legal/compliance audiences.
- Translate into user-level behavior: maintain an audit trail for medium/high-stakes work.
