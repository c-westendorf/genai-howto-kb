# Why this matters
Simple, teachable behaviors for moving users beyond “copy/paste the first answer.”

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Treat the model like an intern: break tasks down, provide progressive support.
- Use a stepwise approach (outline → details → check → final).
- Iterate with the model; don’t accept first output.
- Be intentional about when to consult AI to avoid anchoring your thinking.

# How to incorporate
- Use as a beginner-friendly reference in onboarding Modules 2–3.

# Limitations / cautions
- Educational guidance; not a formal benchmark.
