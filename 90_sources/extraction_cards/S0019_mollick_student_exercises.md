# Why this matters
A ready-made set of practice prompts and exercises with a clear license statement (CC BY for prompts on that page).

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Provides structured exercises that can be repurposed into onboarding labs.
- Encourages “use prompts at your own risk” and acknowledges outputs may be incorrect.

# How to incorporate
- Use as inspiration for the onboarding exercise library.
- Keep attribution requirements in mind if copying prompts verbatim.

# Limitations / cautions
- Not research evidence; it’s curriculum material.
