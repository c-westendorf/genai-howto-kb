# Why this matters
A baseline, lifecycle-oriented security standard that can be used to structure “trust & risk” practices for genAI systems.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Focuses on baseline cyber security requirements for AI models/systems.
- Helps align security work to phases (design, development, deployment, operations).
- Useful as a mapping target for internal checklists.

# How to incorporate
- Use ETSI as the backbone for the security module and for any enterprise-facing guidance.
- Cross-link to NCSC prompt injection post, which explicitly references ETSI TS 104 223.
