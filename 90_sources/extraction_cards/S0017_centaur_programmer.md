# Why this matters
Provides a vocabulary for collaboration modes that generalize beyond coding.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Argues human+AI collaboration can outperform either alone (centaur framing).
- Describes collaboration models:
  - guidance model
  - sketch model
  - inverted control model

# How to incorporate
- Map these models to knowledge work patterns:
  - guidance → “AI proposes, human steers”
  - sketch → “human outlines, AI fills”
  - inverted control → “AI leads small steps, human approves”

# Limitations / cautions
- A perspective piece; not a controlled study.
