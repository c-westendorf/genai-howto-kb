# Why this matters
A shared vocabulary and structure for “trust” that is compatible with genAI work: risk is probability *and* impact.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Risk management framing helps decide how much verification is required.
- Encourages governance processes, documentation, and ongoing monitoring.

# How to incorporate
- Use as the backbone for the **Trust Levels** matrix (see `/02_trust/trust_levels_and_risk.md`).
- Map user-level practices (verification, pushback) to organizational controls.
