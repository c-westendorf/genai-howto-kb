# Why this matters
Claude’s docs are especially strong on systematic prompt design, long-horizon tasks, and structuring instructions.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Be explicit about goals, constraints, and desired reasoning style.
- Use examples carefully (models may imitate them).
- For complex tasks: do it in steps and keep state.

# How to incorporate
- Use alongside OpenAI best practices to teach model-agnostic prompt patterns.

# Limitations
- Vendor-specific examples; ensure portability.
