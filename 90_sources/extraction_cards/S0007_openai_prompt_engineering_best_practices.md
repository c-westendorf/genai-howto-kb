# Why this matters
This doc provides widely-cited, practical prompting heuristics useful for onboarding.

# Key takeaways (operational)
- Put instructions early; use clear separators.
- Be specific about format, length, and constraints.
- Show examples (“few-shot”) when output shape matters.
- Iterate: prompt engineering is empirical.

# How to incorporate
- Use as the baseline set of “prompt hygiene” rules in Module 2 (Context engineering).

# Limitations
- General-purpose guidelines; must be adapted for specific org policies and model behaviors.
