# GenAI Usage Guide

## What this is

A practical guide for working effectively with generative AI. Use it to:

- Build a mental model of how to think about genAI work
- Avoid common pitfalls (context bloat, hallucination traps, trust miscalibration)
- Get decision support when you're stuck
- Grab playbooks for common tasks

## How to use this guide

**If you're new**: Start with [Core Concepts](concepts/index.md) to build your mental model.

**If you're mid-task**: Jump to [Playbooks](playbooks/index.md) or [Decision Support](decisions/index.md).

**If you're stuck**: Check [Pitfalls & Fixes](pitfalls/index.md).

**If you want to level up**: See [Evolution Map](evolution.md).

## The 60-second version

GenAI is a **thought partner**, not a vending machine. The shift:

| From (Transactional) | To (Thought Partnership) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Ask once, accept answer | Explore options, select, refine |
| Hope it's right | Calibrate trust to stakes |
| Paste everything in | Engineer context deliberately |
| One prompt, one output | Parallel threads, merge results |

**The core loop**: Explore → Select → Refine

**The core skill**: Context engineering

**The core discipline**: Trust calibration

### Core Concepts
- [Context Engineering](concepts/context_engineering.md) — how you package input determines output quality
- [Explore → Select → Refine](concepts/explore_select_refine.md) — the thought partnership loop
- [Trust Calibration](concepts/trust_calibration.md) — match verification to stakes
- [Parallel Execution](concepts/parallel_execution.md) — scale thinking with multiple threads
- [Decision Flow](concepts/decision_flow.md) — the meta-question: what pattern fits?

### When things go wrong
- [Context Bloat](pitfalls/context_bloat.md) — outputs getting worse as you add more
- [Hallucinations](pitfalls/hallucinations.md) — confident but fabricated
- [Getting Stuck](pitfalls/getting_stuck.md) — escape prompts and reframing

### Quick reference
- [Explore prompts](reference/prompts/explore.md)
