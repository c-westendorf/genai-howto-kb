# GenAI Usage Guide

A practical guide for working effectively with generative AI. This is a cognitive toolkit — pick it up when you need it.

## Start Here

👉 **[START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)** — Entry point, 60-second overview, quick links

## Guide Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [**Concepts**](concepts/index.md) | Core mental models (context engineering, explore/select/refine, trust calibration, one-shot planning) |
| [**Pitfalls**](pitfalls/index.md) | Common problems and fixes (context bloat, hallucinations, getting stuck) |
| [**Decisions**](decisions/index.md) | Decision support ("what pattern?", "how much verification?", "start over?") |
| [**Playbooks**](playbooks/index.md) | Task-specific guides (writing, analysis, code, meetings) + role-specific patterns (GSD+RALPH, DS, MLE, Business) |
| [**Reference**](reference/index.md) | Copy-paste prompts, checklists, templates |
| [**Evolution**](evolution.md) | Capability progression map (L1 → L4) |

## Supporting Materials

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [Glossary](00_meta/glossary.md) | Key terms defined |
| [Sources Index](90_sources/sources_index.md) | Research and references backing this guide |
| [archive/](archive/) | Original source materials (superseded by current structure) |

## The Big Idea

GenAI is a **thought partner**, not a vending machine.

| From (Transactional) | To (Thought Partnership) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Ask once, accept answer | Explore options, select, refine |
| Hope it's right | Calibrate trust to stakes |
| Paste everything in | Engineer context deliberately |
| One prompt, one output | Parallel threads, merge results |

**Core loop**: Explore → Select → Refine
**Core skill**: Context engineering
**Core discipline**: Trust calibration

## How to Use This Guide

- **New to genAI?** Start with [Core Concepts](concepts/index.md)
- **Mid-task?** Jump to [Playbooks](playbooks/index.md) or [Decisions](decisions/index.md)
- **Stuck?** Check [Pitfalls & Fixes](pitfalls/index.md)
- **Want to level up?** See [Evolution Map](evolution.md)
