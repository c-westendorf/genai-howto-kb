# Evolution Map

Where you might be, where you might go, and what unlocks each level.

This isn't a curriculum — it's a map. Use it to orient yourself and find what to learn next.

---

## Level 1: Transactional

**Where you are:**
- Single prompts, accept first answer
- Hope it's right
- Paste everything in
- Treat genAI as a search engine that writes

**What's limiting you:**
- You're getting the average answer, not the best answer
- No exploration of alternatives
- Context is unstructured
- Iteration feels random

**What to learn next:**
- [Context Engineering](concepts/context_engineering.md) — structure your input
- The explore phase of [Explore → Select → Refine](concepts/explore_select_refine.md)

**Key unlock:**
> The prompt is the smallest part. Context is everything.

---

## Level 2: Structured

**Where you are:**
- Using context packs (role, task, constraints)
- Iterating on outputs
- Getting better results more consistently
- Starting to structure input deliberately

**What's limiting you:**
- Still accepting first approach (just refining it)
- Not exploring alternatives before committing
- Trust calibration is intuitive, not explicit

**What to learn next:**
- Full [Explore → Select → Refine](concepts/explore_select_refine.md) loop
- [Trust Calibration](concepts/trust_calibration.md) — match verification to stakes

**Key unlock:**
> GenAI is a thought partner, not a tool. Make it show you options before you commit.

---

## Level 3: Thought Partner

**Where you are:**
- Running the full explore/select/refine loop
- Consciously choosing trust levels
- Making explicit decisions with criteria
- Catching more errors through verification

**What's limiting you:**
- Still single-threaded (one conversation, one approach)
- Not yet building reusable assets
- Can't scale thinking across multiple perspectives

**What to learn next:**
- [Parallel Execution](concepts/parallel_execution.md) — multiple threads, merge results
- Template creation — reusable context packs and prompts

**Key unlock:**
> You can run multiple threads simultaneously and merge the best of each.

---

## Level 4: Scaled Operator

**Where you are:**
- Parallel execution across threads
- Reusable templates and context packs
- Consistent results across tasks
- Teaching others how to use genAI effectively

**What's limiting you:**
- Edge cases and novel situations
- Advanced verification for high-stakes domains
- Building team-wide patterns

**What to learn next:**
- Advanced [pitfalls](pitfalls/index.md) and edge cases
- Domain-specific playbooks
- Building institutional playbooks for your team

**Key unlock:**
> You're not just using genAI — you're building reusable systems for your team.

## Self-Assessment

| If you... | You're probably at... |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Accept first answer without review | Level 0-1 |
| Use context packs but skip exploration | Level 1-2 |
| Explore options, then iterate on one | Level 2-3 |
| Run explore/select/refine consciously | Level 3 |
| Use parallel threads, share templates | Level 4 |

## Quick orientation

| Level | Core behavior | Core skill | Core discipline |
|-------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Ask and accept | Writing prompts | None |
| 2 | Structure and iterate | Context engineering | Iteration |
| 3 | Explore, select, refine | Thought partnership | Verification |
| 4 | Parallelize and scale | Pattern building | Teaching |

## What to do now

1. **Find your level** using the self-assessment above
2. **Read the "what to learn next"** for that level
3. **Pick one concept** and apply it to your next task
4. **Notice the difference** in output quality

Don't try to jump levels. Each level builds on the previous one.

If you're not sure where to start: [Context Engineering](concepts/context_engineering.md) is the foundation.
